The two bash scripts are for execution of the client and server programs.
The arrayclient.sh is to run the client program with three parameters passed 
1. IP address of the server program 
2. Size of the array which will be sent from client program to server program
3. Number of times the array will be sent.

The arrayserver.sh is to execute the server program with no parameters.

The client program was run on one machine and the server program was run on another machine. Programs were tested on four nodes(csews10,csews11,csews29,csews30).
Two tools(iperf,netperf) were used to measure the bandwidth of the channel between two nodes while the client-server programs were executing on the two nodes.
The data which was used to create the plots was deducted from more than 10 runs for each data size. 
The data entries present in the data files are the average of 10 runs(minimum) for each data size.This was done to avoid the varation recorded by the two tools netperf,netperf.
There was a varation of 0-2MB between executions for the same data size.

Another measurement for bandwith was done wile sending data from multiple clients to one server. The same process was applied to this one also as described above.
